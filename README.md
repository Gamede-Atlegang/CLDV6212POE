ABC Retailers - Azure Storage Integration
Project Summary
A comprehensive retail management web application demonstrating full integration with Azure Storage services. The application provides a complete solution for managing customers, products, orders, and file uploads using Azure Tables, Blob Storage, Queues, and File Shares.
Azure Storage Services Implemented
1. Azure Tables
Customers Table: Customer profiles (name, email, address, username)
Products Table: Product information (name, description, price, stock, image URL)
Orders Table: Order details (customer, product, quantity, pricing, status)

2. Azure Blob Storage
product-images Container: Public access for product images
payment-proofs Container: Private access for sensitive documents

3. Azure Queues
order-notifications Queue: Order creation and processing messages
stock-updates Queue: Inventory management notifications

4. Azure File Shares
contracts Share: Organized storage for contracts and payment proofs

Technical Architecture
Controllers
HomeController: Dashboard and error handling
CustomerController: Customer CRUD operations
ProductController: Product management with image uploads
OrderController: Order processing with AJAX pricing
UploadController: File upload to Azure File Share
Models
Customer: ITableEntity implementation
Product: ITableEntity with image URL support
Order: ITableEntity with pricing and status
FileUploadModel: File upload form model
HomeViewModel: Dashboard statistics
ErrorViewModel: Error handling
Services
IAzureStorageService: Interface defining all Azure operations
AzureStorageService: Complete implementation with:
Table operations (CRUD with ETag support)
Blob upload with content type preservation
Queue messaging
File Share operations with proper API usage
Setup Instructions
Prerequisites
Visual Studio 2022
Azure account with Storage Account
.NET 8.0 SDK
Azure Setup
Create Azure Storage Account
Get connection string from Access Keys
Update appsettings.json with connection string
Local Development
Clone repository
Open solution in Visual Studio
Update connection string in appsettings.json
Build and run application
Azure resources auto-created on first run
Deployment
Create Azure App Service
Configure connection string in App Service settings
Deploy from Visual Studio or GitHub
Verify all Azure Storage resources accessible
Key Technical Solutions
Data Type Handling
Used double for prices (Azure Tables doesn't support decimal)
Proper currency formatting with ToString("C2")
Numeric inputs with step validation
Concurrency Control
ETag support for optimistic concurrency
Fallback to ETag.All for missing ETags
Proper error handling for concurrency conflicts
File Management
Image uploads to Blob Storage with public access
Payment proofs to File Share with organized directories
Content type preservation for uploaded files
Real-time Features
AJAX price calculation in order creation
Dynamic stock validation
Queue-based notifications
Scalability & Reliability Features
Scalability
Stateless Design: Horizontal scaling capability
Azure Tables: Partitioned storage for high performance
Blob Storage: CDN-ready for global image delivery
Queues: Decoupled processing for high throughput
Reliability
Connection String Management: Secure configuration
Error Handling: Comprehensive exception management
ETag Support: Optimistic concurrency for data integrity
Auto-Resource Creation: Ensures required Azure resources exist
Cost Effectiveness
Standard Storage: Balanced performance and cost
Locally Redundant Storage: Cost-effective redundancy
Efficient Queries: Optimized table queries
Proper Resource Management: No unnecessary storage usage
Testing Scenarios
Basic Functionality
Add customer → Verify Azure Tables
Add product with image → Verify Blob Storage
Create order → Verify stock updates and queue messages
Upload payment proof → Verify File Share
Advanced Features
Concurrency: Multiple users editing same record
Error Handling: Invalid file uploads, network issues
Performance: Large number of records
Security: Connection string protection
