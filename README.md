ABC Retailers - Azure Storage Integration

📋 Project Summary
A comprehensive retail management web application demonstrating full integration with Azure Storage services. The application provides a complete solution for managing customers, products, orders, and file uploads using Azure Tables, Blob Storage, Queues, and File Shares.

☁️ Azure Storage Services Implemented

1. Azure Tables
Customers Table: Customer profiles (name, email, address, username)
Products Table: Product information (name, description, price, stock, image URL)
Orders Table: Order details (customer, product, quantity, pricing, status)

2. Azure Blob Storage
product-images Container: Public access for product images
payment-proofs Container: Private access for sensitive documents

3. Azure Queues
order-notifications Queue: Order creation and processing messages
stock-updates Queue: Inventory management notifications

4. Azure File Shares
contracts Share: Organized storage for contracts and payment proofs

�� Core Features

👥 Customer Management
Complete CRUD operations for customer profiles
Form validation and error handling
Azure Table Storage integration

�� Product Management
Product CRUD with image upload to Azure Blob Storage
Real-time stock level tracking with visual indicators
Price management with proper decimal handling
Image preservation during edits

�� Order Management
Order creation with customer/product dropdowns
Real-time price calculation via AJAX
Stock validation and automatic updates
Order status management (Pending, Processing, Completed, Cancelled)
Queue notifications for order events

�� File Upload System
Payment proof uploads to Azure File Share
File type validation and size restrictions
Organized storage in payments directory

🏗️ Technical Architecture

🎮 Controllers
HomeController: Dashboard and error handling
CustomerController: Customer CRUD operations
ProductController: Product management with image uploads
OrderController: Order processing with AJAX pricing
UploadController: File upload to Azure File Share

�� Models
Customer: ITableEntity implementation
Product: ITableEntity with image URL support
Order: ITableEntity with pricing and status
FileUploadModel: File upload form model
HomeViewModel: Dashboard statistics
ErrorViewModel: Error handling

�� Services
IAzureStorageService: Interface defining all Azure operations
AzureStorageService: Complete implementation with:
Table operations (CRUD with ETag support)
Blob upload with content type preservation
Queue messaging
File Share operations with proper API usage

⚙️ Setup Instructions

📋 Prerequisites
Visual Studio 2022
Azure account with Storage Account
.NET 8.0 SDK

☁️ Azure Setup
Create Azure Storage Account
Get connection string from Access Keys
Update appsettings.json with connection string

�� Local Development
Clone repository
Open solution in Visual Studio
Update connection string in appsettings.json
Build and run application
Azure resources auto-created on first run

🚀 Deployment
Create Azure App Service
Configure connection string in App Service settings
Deploy from Visual Studio or GitHub
Verify all Azure Storage resources accessible

🔧 Key Technical Solutions

�� Data Type Handling
Used double for prices (Azure Tables doesn't support decimal)
Proper currency formatting with ToString("C2")
Numeric inputs with step validation

🔄 Concurrency Control
ETag support for optimistic concurrency
Fallback to ETag.All for missing ETags
Proper error handling for concurrency conflicts

📁 File Management
Image uploads to Blob Storage with public access
Payment proofs to File Share with organized directories
Content type preservation for uploaded files

⚡ Real-time Features
AJAX price calculation in order creation
Dynamic stock validation
Queue-based notifications

📈 Scalability & Reliability Features

📈 Scalability
Stateless Design: Horizontal scaling capability
Azure Tables: Partitioned storage for high performance
Blob Storage: CDN-ready for global image delivery
Queues: Decoupled processing for high throughput

🛡️ Reliability
Connection String Management: Secure configuration
Error Handling: Comprehensive exception management
ETag Support: Optimistic concurrency for data integrity
Auto-Resource Creation: Ensures required Azure resources exist

�� Cost Effectiveness
Standard Storage: Balanced performance and cost
Locally Redundant Storage: Cost-effective redundancy
Efficient Queries: Optimized table queries
Proper Resource Management: No unnecessary storage usage

🧪 Testing Scenarios

✅ Basic Functionality
Add customer → Verify Azure Tables
Add product with image → Verify Blob Storage
Create order → Verify stock updates and queue messages
Upload payment proof → Verify File Share

�� Advanced Features
Concurrency: Multiple users editing same record
Error Handling: Invalid file uploads, network issues
Performance: Large number of records
Security: Connection string protection

🔧 Troubleshooting

❗ Common Issues
Connection String Error: Verify Azure Storage connection string
Resource Creation Failed: Check Azure permissions
Image Upload Issues: Verify blob container permissions
Queue Messages: Check queue client configuration

�� Debug Information
Enable detailed logging in appsettings.json
Check Azure Storage metrics in portal
Verify resource creation in Azure portal

🔮 Future Enhancements
User authentication and authorization
Advanced reporting and analytics
Integration with payment gateways
Mobile application support
Advanced search and filtering
Bulk import/export functionality

🎯 Project Achievement
This project demonstrates complete integration of all four Azure Storage services (Tables, Blobs, Queues, File Shares) in a production-ready retail management system with proper error handling, concurrency control, and scalability considerations.
